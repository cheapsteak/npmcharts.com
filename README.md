### What it does
* [Jade](http://jade-lang.com) files to HTML
* [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus) files to CSS
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) files to Javascript through [browserify](http://browserify.org/)
    * You are able to use 'require' in your client-side code
* Serves your static files to localhost:9001
* Reloads your browser with LiveReload when files change

## Getting things up and running
- Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)

```
 git clone git@github.com:leonidas/gulp-project-template.git <your project name>
 cd <your project name>
 npm install
 npm start
 open http://localhost:9001 in your browser
````
### Enable LiveReload
Install [LiveReload for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en)

## CLI Commands
* npm install
    * Installs server-side dependencies from NPM and client-side dependencies from Bower
* npm start
    * Compiles your files, starts watching files for changes, serves static files to port 9001
* npm run build
    * Builds everything

Minification, uglification and other tasks you're expected to run before deploying your product can be made by running the build command with env variable NODE_ENV set to "production"

    NODE_ENV=production npm run build

## Development guidelines
* **public** - directory should be dedicated only to compiled/copied files from **src** - directory.
  It should be possible to delete directory completely and after **npm start** or **npm run build** everything should be as they were before the deletion.
* All backend dependencies should be installed with **npm**. Browser dependencies should be installed with **bower** or with **npm**.

### Using JavaScript instead of CoffeeScript
Remove coffeeify transform from package.json file (browserify.transform field)
```diff
    "transform": [
-     "coffeeify",
      "debowerify",
      "deamdify"
    ]
```

and change the ".coffee" extension to ".js" from gulpfile.coffee
```diff
config =
  scripts:
-   source: './src/coffee/main.coffee'
-   extensions: ['.coffee']
+   source: './src/js/main.js'
+   extensions: ['.js']
```
You also can change the directory name to scripts or what ever.
